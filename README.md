# WaterLeakDetector
The Water Leak Detector (WLD) is an IoT device that can monitor two specific locations for the presence of water. When water is detected an alarm will sound and an alert will be sent to a smartphone. 

A typical use case is to deploy the WLD in a laundry room where it can monitor water leaks that might occur from a washing machine, hot water heater, or sewer backup.

The WLD also includes a temperature and humidity sensor. These values are displayed on a dial and also in a smartphone app. 

The Water Leak Detector is also an excellent platform for IoT sensor deployment. The two water leak sensors could be replaced with any sensor that makes a connection when an alarm condition is reached. It is also possible to periodically publish temperature and humitidy readings to the cloud - such as a Google Docs spreadsheet - for later analysis.
